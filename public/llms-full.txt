## Industries Served (Detailed)

### Private Equity Portfolio Companies

**Challenge:** Portfolio companies need fast operational wins to hit value creation milestones. Traditional consulting takes too long and delivers PowerPoints, not production systems.

**Our approach:** We deliver working AI agents in 6-8 weeks that immediately impact pipeline, forecast accuracy, and sales productivity. Fast wins your investment committee can measure.

**Key outcomes:**
- Rapid time-to-value for portfolio operations
- Measurable impact on revenue metrics
- Scalable systems across portfolio companies

### Insurance

**Challenge:** Insurance producers juggle policies, renewals, cross-sell opportunities, and compliance requirements. Most spend more time on admin than selling.

**Our approach:** We enable producers. Simple as that. Our agents handle policy tracking, renewal reminders, cross-sell identification, and compliance documentation so your producers can focus on relationships and new business.

**Key outcomes:**
- Producer enablement and productivity gains
- Automated policy and renewal intelligence
- Compliance-ready documentation

### Manufacturing

**Challenge:** Manufacturing sales cycles are long, products are complex, and tracking opportunities across multi-year timelines is difficult. Traditional CRM wasn't built for this.

**Our approach:** We build AI agents that understand long-cycle B2B sales. Track opportunities across years, not quarters. Manage complex product configurations and quote histories. Surface expansion opportunities in existing accounts.

**Key outcomes:**
- Long-cycle opportunity tracking
- Complex product configuration management
- Multi-year account intelligence
